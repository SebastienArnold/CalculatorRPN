# TODO
## What's missing due to time restriction ?

- Manage multiple instance of stack (At least one by user)
Because this multiple stack management introduce more API not in the initial document (Authentication or a step to create his own stack and have an identifier for the other operations) and for the short time it's actually running with a unique stack.

- Error management
A quick pass was done to manage error but some interesting logs have to be added.

- UnitTests Coverage and Integration test
Have created some unitTest during implementation (TDD) but not checked coverage value and have not implemented any integration tests
